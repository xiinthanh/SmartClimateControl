# Smart Climate Control

A Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) based Smart Climate Control System that monitors and adjusts the temperature and humidity of an environment using sensors and actuators. The system will control a cooler, heater, and humidifier to maintain optimal conditions. Since this project is a demo for RTOS course, some logical operations are proposed to play a demo, and not be closed to real operations.
